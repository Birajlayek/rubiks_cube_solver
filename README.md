## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents the development of a high-performance **Rubik's Cube (3x3) solver** in **C++**. The project focused on the practical application and performance analysis of both fundamental and advanced **graph traversal algorithms**. 

Three distinct class models were designed to represent the cube, allowing for a comparative study of data structure efficiency. The solver implements the following algorithms:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)**
- **Korf's Iterative Deepening A\* (IDA\*)**

The implementation achieved remarkable efficiency:
- **Moderately scrambled cubes (8 moves)**: Solved in under **3 seconds**
- **Complex configurations (13 moves)**: Solved in under **10 seconds**

## 3. Technical Design and Algorithmic Implementation

The project was developed in **C++** to leverage its performance benefits and low-level memory control.

### Cube Representation

Three distinct C++ class models were created using:
- **Multi-dimensional arrays**
- **`std::vector` containers**

Each model was evaluated based on:
- Memory usage
- Manipulation ease (e.g., rotating faces)
- Overall algorithmic performance

### Search Algorithms Implemented

- üîÑ **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  Guarantees the shortest path but is memory-intensive. Best for simple scrambles.

- üß¨ **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
  Memory-efficient but does not guarantee optimal solutions.

- ‚è≥ **Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)**  
  Combines DFS's memory efficiency with BFS's optimality via depth-limited iterations.

- üß† **Korf's IDA\* Algorithm**  
  An informed search using heuristics (e.g., pattern databases) to estimate steps to the goal. Efficient for deep scrambles.
